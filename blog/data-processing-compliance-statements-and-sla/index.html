    <div id="post" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The Apache Software Foundation is a non commercial, open source organization that relies on a large community of volunteers and companies to maintain its software. It provides this software freely (and gratis) &lsquo;as is&rsquo; - as per <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">its license</a>.</p>
<p>As such we are not a &lsquo;vendor&rsquo; or a &lsquo;supplier&rsquo;, but a steward. While you agree to our aforementioned <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">license</a> agreement, the Apache Software Foundation does not commit to things that a vendor or supplier would usually commit to, such as providing a typical commercial helpdesk, commercial support, a 24x7 service level agreement and so on.</p>
<p>For readers not yet familiar, it might be interesting to read more about <a href="https://apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html">how the ASF works</a>, and consider participating.</p>
<h1 id="service-level-agreement">Service Level Agreement</h1>
<p>While we strive to keep our software secure and up to date - the
<a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">license</a>,
under which our software was provided to you, does <em>not</em> come with a Service
Level Agreement.</p>
<p>There are no strict pre-agreed timelines for Apache releases or security patches:
when handling security issues projects take a risk-based approach, where issues
that are likely to have serious downstream consequences are dealt with quickly,
while issues with less impact may be fixed in the regular release cadence.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://apache.org/security">Apache Security Team</a> monitors this process,
and projects that fail to meet reasonable response times will be retired
following our <a href="https://attic.apache.org">Attic process</a>. If you want to prevent
this from happening, the best way is to join the project community while it&rsquo;s
healthy and actively contribute (security) analyses and improvements.</p>
<h1 id="data-processing">Data processing</h1>
<p>While The Apache Software Foundation provides software that can process user data, we do not process your user data for you. We only provide the software under an  <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">open source license</a>. We do not run it. And thus are not involved in any processing of Personally Identifiable Data (PII) that it may do.</p>
<p>This means we are not a Data Processor in the sense of the GDPR or its international equivalents: whoever is running the software is the data processor.
Therefore there is no reason to sign any kind of Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with us.</p>
<p>If someone else is running Apache software on your behalf, such as Amazon WebServices, you might need a DPA with them. For example when that party processes data for you.</p>
<h1 id="compliance-statements">Compliance statements</h1>
<p>We do not directly provide any compliance statements or reports (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_and_Organization_Controls">SOC</a>, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/regcccg.htm">CC</a>, <a href="https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/">STIG</a>, <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis">CJIS</a>, <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/resources/usgbc-antitrust-compliance-policy">USGBC</a>, <a href="https://www.section508.gov/">508</a>, etc).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many organizations that use Apache software projects have successfully passed various audits and received the corresponding certification.</p>
<p>This is in part due to the fact that as a responsible Open Source Steward, we have a solid <a href="https://apache.org/foundation/governance/">governance structure</a> in place, with <a href="https://apache.org/foundation/governance/pmcs.html">Program Management Committees</a> overseeing the projects, and <a href="https://apache.org/foundation/governance/board.html">the board</a> setting overall policy for the foundation.</p>
<p>In particular, any software that is released will adhere to the <a href="https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html">release policy</a> and follows <a href="https://infra.apache.org/release-publishing.html">best practices</a>, and security issues are handled according to our <a href="https://apache.org/security/committers.html">security process</a>.</p>
<p>You may either complete various certifications in house, by using a third party or by procuring the software from a commercial entity that provides such services. We cannot make any particular recommendations, but if that is relevant to you that might be something to seek out.</p>
<h1 id="provenance-and-export-restrictions">Provenance and export restrictions</h1>
<p>As a Delaware incorporated 501(c)3 organisation the Apache Software Foundation
labours under the rules and regulation of the United States. We have a
<a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/exports/">separate page</a> dedicated to detailed
information on the export control status of the Apache Software Foundation&rsquo;s
releases.</p>
<p>The provenance of code contributed to the Apache Software Foundation is tracked
carefully through <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/#grants">CLAs and Software Grants</a>,
as well as the terms of the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">license</a>
itself. Even with that solid foundation, however, the trustworthiness of our code
comes mainly from the transparency that we practice in all aspects of development.</p>
<h1 id="attic">Attic</h1>
<p>The Attic contains historic code that is no longer fit for purpose. It is code that can no longer be used as it was originally intended. A project that was moved to the <a href="https://attic.apache.org">Attic</a> is not subject to our various security- and release-policies. It is no longer considered a release by the Apache Software Foundation.</p>
