  <div id="post-box">
    <div id="post" itemprop="articleBody"><p>We highly appreciate everyone who responsibly <a href="https://www.apache.org/security/">reports security issues</a>
to us: a diverse mix of community members, independent security researchers,
software auditing firms, etc.</p>
<p>When we release a fix for a vulnerability in one of our projects, we
publish a security advisory crediting the reporter, and distribute it though
various Apache <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html">mailinglists</a>, <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/">oss-security</a> and the
<a href="https://www.cve.org/">CVE</a> programme: this way, we proactively signal the
urgency to upgrade to our users.</p>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation, being a volunteer organization, does not have
a bug bounty program. However, some Apache projects are covered under 3rd-party
bounty programs such as the
<a href="https://hackerone.com/ibb">HackerOne Internet Bug Bounty</a>.</p>
<p>Notifications about possible security issues in the infrastructure that makes
development possible, such as websites, CI systems and other supporting
software, are also very welcome.</p>
<p>There are some classes of common reports that we consider invalid up-front:</p>
<ul>
<li>We already know our mailservers do not use DKIM/DMARC. We plan to support this in the future, but this is nontrivial given our strong reliance on mailinglists.</li>
<li>As an open source organization with transparency at our core, read access to directory listings, source code repositories and build servers is intentionally public.</li>
<li>If a project has a dependency for which a security advisory has been published, this is not in itself a vulnerability in the project, as more often than not the dependency is used in a way that is not affected by the issue in the advisory. Only if you have additional analysis to confirm the project is affected you&rsquo;re invited to report this through the private reporting mechanism.</li>
<li>Similarly, results from source code security analysis tools are not accepted without additional analysis showing the problem indeed violates the projects&rsquo; security model, as such tools commonly produce a significant amount of false positives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Valid reports about our project infrastructure are typically not eligible
for a CVE, as downstream users do not need to take any action,
so they do not need to be notified.</p>
<p>Still, as a token of our appreciation, we&rsquo;d like to thank a number of such reporters here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/redyetidev">Aviv Keller</a> for helping identify a number of XSS problems in various Apache project websites.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harish-p-62b38a158">Harish</a> for working with us to resolve a <a href="https://medium.com/apache-airflow/unraveling-the-code-navigating-a-ci-release-security-vulnerability-in-apache-airflow-620214a96297">GitHub Actions issue</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/Cursered">Li Jiantao</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/starlabs_sg">STAR Labs SG Pte. Ltd.</a> for reporting a problem with an internal administrative tool.</li>
</ul>
