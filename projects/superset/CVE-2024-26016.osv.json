However, it's important to note that access to the analytical data of these charts and dashboards would still be subject to validation based on data access privileges.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 3.0.4, from 3.1.0 before 3.1.1.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.1.1, which fixes the issue.\n\n", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "0"}, {"fixed": "3.0.4"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "3.1.0"}, {"fixed": "3.1.1"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/76v1jjcylgk4p3m0258qr359ook3vl8s"}]}
