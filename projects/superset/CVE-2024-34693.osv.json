If both the MariaDB server (off by default) and the local mysql client on the web server are set to allow for local infile, it's possible for the attacker to execute a specific MySQL/MariaDB SQL command that is able to read files from the server and insert their content on a MariaDB database table.This issue affects Apache Superset: before 3.1.3 and version 4.0.0\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.1 or 3.1.3, which fixes the issue.\n\n", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "0"}, {"fixed": "3.1.3"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "4.0.0"}, {"fixed": "4.0.1"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/1803x1s34m7r71h1k0q1njol8k6fmyon"}]}
