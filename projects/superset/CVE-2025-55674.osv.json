{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2025-55674", "summary": "Improper SQL authorisation, parse not checking for specific engine functions", "details": "A bypass of the DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS security feature in Apache Superset allows for the execution of blocked SQL functions. An attacker can use a special inline block to circumvent the denylist. This allows a user with SQL Lab access to execute functions that were intended to be disabled, leading to the disclosure of sensitive database information like the software version.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 5.0.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 5.0.0, which fixes the issue.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "0"}, {"fixed": "5.0.0"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/cn49ps15ny3g2b1qzdg5mj7hp47p5jdo"}]}
