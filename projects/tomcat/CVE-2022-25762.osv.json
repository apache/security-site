{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2022-25762", "summary": "Response mix-up with WebSocket concurrent send and close", "details": "If a web application sends a WebSocket message concurrently with the WebSocket connection closing when running on Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.75 or Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.20, it is possible that the application will continue to use the socket after it has been closed. The error handling triggered in this case could cause the a pooled object to be placed in the pool twice. This could result in subsequent connections using the same object concurrently which could result in data being returned to the wrong use and/or other errors.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "Apache Tomcat 9 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.20"}, {"last_affected": "Apache Tomcat 9 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.20"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "Apache Tomcat 8.5 8.5.0 to 8.5.75"}, {"last_affected": "Apache Tomcat 8.5 8.5.0 to 8.5.75"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/6ckmjfb1k61dyzkto9vm2k5jvt4o7w7c"}]}
