<li>Apache Pulsar from Apache Pulsar through 2.8.0</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="description-1">Description</h3>
<p>In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user.</p>
<p>The Admin API get-message-by-id requires the user to input a topic and a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it is supposed to be a valid it for the topic.
Authorisation controls are performed against the topic name and there is not proper validation the that ledger id is valid in the context of such ledger.
So it may happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data owned by another tenant.</p>
<p>This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache Pulsar version 2.8.0 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.7.3 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.6.4 and prior versions.</p>

<h3 id="description-2">Description</h3>
<p>Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Proxy component of Apache Pulsar allows an attacker to make TCP/IP connection attempts that originate from the Pulsar Proxy&rsquo;s IP address.</p>
<p>When the Apache Pulsar Proxy component is used, it is possible to attempt to open TCP/IP connections to any IP address and port that the Pulsar Proxy can connect to. An attacker could use this as a way for DoS attacks that originate from the Pulsar Proxy&rsquo;s IP address.
It hasn’t been detected that the Pulsar Proxy authentication can be bypassed. The attacker will have to have a valid token to a properly secured Pulsar Proxy.</p>
<p>This issue affects Apache Pulsar Proxy versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.2; 2.9.0 to 2.9.1; 2.6.4 and earlier.</p>

<li>Apache Pulsar from 2.8 through 2.8.3</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="description-3">Description</h3>
<p>Delayed TLS hostname verification in the Pulsar Java Client and the Pulsar Proxy make each client vulnerable to a man in the middle attack. Connections from the Pulsar Java Client to the Pulsar Broker/Proxy and connections from the Pulsar Proxy to the Pulsar Broker are vulnerable. Authentication data is sent before verifying the server’s TLS certificate matches the hostname, which means authentication data could be exposed to an attacker.</p>
<p>An attacker can only take advantage of this vulnerability by taking control of a machine &lsquo;between&rsquo; the client and the server. The attacker must then actively manipulate traffic to perform the attack by providing the client with a cryptographically valid certificate for an unrelated host. Because the client sends authentication data before performing hostname verification, an attacker could gain access to the client’s authentication data. The client eventually closes the connection when it verifies the hostname and identifies the targeted hostname does not match a hostname on the certificate.</p>
<p>Because the client eventually closes the connection, the value of the intercepted authentication data depends on the authentication method used by the client. Token based authentication and username/password authentication methods are vulnerable because the authentication data can be used to impersonate the client in a separate session.</p>
<p>This issue affects Apache Pulsar Java Client versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2; 2.10.0; 2.6.4 and earlier.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="description-6">Description</h3>
<p>The Apache Pulsar C++ Client does not verify peer TLS certificates when making HTTPS calls for the OAuth2.0 Client Credential Flow, even when tlsAllowInsecureConnection is disabled via configuration. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a man in the middle attack and intercept and/or modify the GET request that is sent to the ClientCredentialFlow &lsquo;issuer url&rsquo;. The intercepted credentials can be used to acquire authentication data from the OAuth2.0 server to then authenticate with an Apache Pulsar cluster.</p>
<p>An attacker can only take advantage of this vulnerability by taking control of a machine &lsquo;between&rsquo; the client and the server. The attacker must then actively manipulate traffic to perform the attack.</p>
<p>The Apache Pulsar Python Client wraps the C++ client, so it is also vulnerable in the same way. This issue affects Apache Pulsar C++ Client and Python Client versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2; 2.10.0 to 2.10.1; 2.6.4 and earlier.</p>
<p>Any users running affected versions of the C++ Client or the Python Client should rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials, including client_id and client_secret.</p>
<p>2.7 C++ and Python Client users should upgrade to 2.7.5 and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials.
2.8 C++ and Python Client users should upgrade to 2.8.4 and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials.
2.9 C++ and Python Client users should upgrade to 2.9.3 and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials.
2.10 C++ and Python Client users should upgrade to 2.10.2 and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials.
3.0 C++ users are unaffected and 3.0 Python Client users will be unaffected when it is released.</p>
<p>Any users running the C++ and Python Client for 2.6 or less should upgrade to one of the above patched versions.</p>

<h3 id="description-7">Description</h3>
<p>Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Pulsar Proxy allows an attacker to connect to the /proxy-stats endpoint without authentication. The vulnerable endpoint exposes detailed statistics about live connections, along with the capability to modify the logging level of proxied connections without requiring proper authentication credentials.<br><br>This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.6.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.2, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, and 3.1.0.<br><br>The known risks include exposing sensitive information such as connected client IP and unauthorized logging level manipulation which could lead to a denial-of-service condition by significantly increasing the proxy&rsquo;s logging overhead. When deployed via the Apache Pulsar Helm chart within Kubernetes environments, the actual client IP might not be revealed through the load balancer&rsquo;s default behavior, which typically obscures the original source IP addresses when externalTrafficPolicy is being configured to &ldquo;Cluster&rdquo; by default. The /proxy-stats endpoint contains topic level statistics, however, in the default configuration, the topic level statistics aren&rsquo;t known to be exposed.<br><br>2.10 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.<br>2.11 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.3.<br>3.0 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.2.<br>3.1 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.1.1.<br><br>Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions. Additionally, it&rsquo;s imperative to recognize that the Apache Pulsar Proxy is not intended for direct exposure to the internet. The architectural design of Pulsar Proxy assumes that it will operate within a secured network environment, safeguarded by appropriate perimeter defenses.</p>

<h3 id="description-16">Description</h3>
<p>The Pulsar Functions Worker includes a capability that permits authenticated users to create functions where the function&rsquo;s implementation is referenced by a URL. The supported URL schemes include &ldquo;file&rdquo;, &ldquo;http&rdquo;, and &ldquo;https&rdquo;. When a function is created using this method, the Functions Worker will retrieve the implementation from the URL provided by the user. However, this feature introduces a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to any file that the Pulsar Functions Worker process has permissions to read. This includes reading the process environment which potentially includes sensitive information, such as secrets. Furthermore, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to use the Pulsar Functions Worker as a proxy to access the content of remote HTTP and HTTPS endpoint URLs. This could also be used to carry out denial of service attacks.<br>This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with &ldquo;functionsWorkerEnabled=true&rdquo;.<br><br>This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. <br><br>2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.<br>2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4.<br>3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.0.3.<br>3.1 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.1.3.<br>3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1.<br><br>Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.<br><br>The updated versions of Pulsar Functions Worker will, by default, impose restrictions on the creation of functions using URLs. For users who rely on this functionality, the Function Worker configuration provides two configuration keys: &ldquo;additionalEnabledConnectorUrlPatterns&rdquo; and &ldquo;additionalEnabledFunctionsUrlPatterns&rdquo;. These keys allow users to specify a set of URL patterns that are permitted, enabling the creation of functions using URLs that match the defined patterns. This approach ensures that the feature remains available to those who require it, while limiting the potential for unauthorized access and exploitation.</p>
