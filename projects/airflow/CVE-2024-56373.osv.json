They can also manually modify historical log file names if they want to see historical logs that were generated before the last log template change.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "0"}, {"fixed": "2.11.1"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/61880"}, {"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/2vrmrhcht6g7cp5yjxpnrk2wtrncm6cy"}]}
