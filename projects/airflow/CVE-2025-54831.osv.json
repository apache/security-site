{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2025-54831", "summary": "Connection sensitive details exposed to users with READ permissions", "details": "Apache Airflow 3 introduced a change to the handling of sensitive information in Connections. The intent was to restrict access to sensitive connection fields to Connection Editing Users, effectively applying a \"write-only\" model for sensitive values.\n\n\nIn Airflow 3.0.3, this model was unintentionally violated: sensitive connection information could be viewed by users with READ permissions through both the API and the UI. This behavior also bypassed the `AIRFLOW__CORE__HIDE_SENSITIVE_VAR_CONN_FIELDS` configuration option.\n\n\nThis issue does not affect Airflow 2.x, where exposing sensitive information to connection editors was the intended and documented behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers of Airflow 3.0.3 are advised to upgrade Airflow to >=3.0.4.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "3.0.3"}, {"last_affected": "3.0.3"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/vblmfqtydrp5zgn2q8tj3slk5podxspf"}]}
