ActiveMQ 5.19.0 is not affected.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.6+, 5.19.0+,  5.18.7+, 5.17.7, or 5.16.8 or which fixes the issue.\n\nExisting users may implement mutual TLS to mitigate the risk on affected brokers.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "6.0.0"}, {"fixed": "6.1.6"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "5.18.0"}, {"fixed": "5.18.7"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "5.17.0"}, {"fixed": "5.17.7"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "5.16.0"}, {"fixed": "5.16.8"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/8hcm25vf7mchg4zbbhnlx2lc5bs705hg"}]}
