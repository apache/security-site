Mitigation: if you do not have Roller configured for untrusted users, then you need to do nothing because you trust your users to author raw HTML and other web content. If you are running with untrusted users then you should upgrade to Roller 6.1.3.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Roller: from 5.0.0 before 6.1.3.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.3, which fixes the issue.\n\n", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "5.0.0"}, {"fixed": "6.1.3"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/lb50jqyxwf8jrfpydl6dc5zpqtpgrrwd"}]}
