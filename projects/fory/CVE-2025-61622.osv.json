{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2025-61622", "summary": "Python RCE via unguarded pickle fallback serializer in pyfory", "details": "Deserialization of untrusted data in python in pyfory versions 0.12.0 through 0.12.2, or the legacy pyfury versions from 0.1.0 through 0.10.3: allows arbitrary code execution. An application is vulnerable if it reads pyfory serialized data from untrusted sources. An attacker can craft a data stream that selects pickle-fallback serializer during deserialization, leading to the execution of `pickle.loads`, which is vulnerable to remote code execution.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to pyfory version 0.12.3 or later, which has removed pickle fallback serializer and thus fixes this issue.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "0.12.0"}, {"last_affected": "0.12.0"}]}]}, {"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "0.1.0"}, {"last_affected": "0.1.0"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/vfn9hp9qt06db5yo1gmj3l114o3o2csd"}]}
