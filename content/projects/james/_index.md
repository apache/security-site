## Apache James vulnerable to STARTTLS command injection (IMAP and POP3) ## { #CVE-2021-38542 }

CVE-2021-38542 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-38542.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-38542.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-01-04T08:46:18.750Z_

### Affected

* Apache James from Apache James before 3.6.1


### Description

Apache James prior to release 3.6.1 is vulnerable to a buffering attack relying on the use of the STARTTLS command. This can result in Man-in -the-middle command injection attacks, leading potentially to leakage of sensible information.

### Affected

* Apache James from Apache James through 3.6.0


### Description

In Apache James, using Jazzer fuzzer, we identified that an IMAP user can craft IMAP LIST commands to orchestrate a Denial Of Service using a vulnerable Regular expression.  This affected Apache James prior to 3.6.1

We recommend upgrading to Apache James 3.6.1 or higher , which enforce the use of RE2J regular expression engine to execute regex in linear time without back-tracking.

## Apache James IMAP parsing Denial Of Service ## { #CVE-2021-40111 }

CVE-2021-40111 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-40111.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-40111.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-01-04T08:48:24.795Z_

### Affected

* Apache James from Apache James through 3.6.0


### Description

In Apache James, while fuzzing with Jazzer the IMAP parsing stack, we discover that crafted APPEND and STATUS IMAP command could be used to trigger infinite loops resulting in expensive CPU computations and OutOfMemory exceptions. This can be used for a Denial Of Service attack. The IMAP user needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.  This affected Apache James prior to version 3.6.1.

This vulnerability had been patched in Apache James 3.6.1 and higher. We recommend the upgrade.

### Affected

* Apache James server through 3.7.4
* Apache James server from 3.8 through 3.8.0


### Description

Apache James prior to version 3.7.5 and 3.8.0 exposes a JMX endpoint on localhost subject to pre-authentication deserialisation of untrusted data.<br>Given a deserialisation gadjet, this could be leveraged as part of an exploit chain that could result in privilege escalation.<br><div>Note that by default JMX endpoint is only bound locally.</div><div><br></div>We recommend users to:<br><div>&nbsp;- Upgrade to a non-vulnerable Apache James version</div><div>&nbsp;- Run Apache James isolated from other processes (docker - dedicated virtual machine)<br>&nbsp;- If possible turn off JMX<br></div>

_Last updated: 2024-02-27T13:07:59.703Z_

### Affected

* Apache James server through 3.7.4
* Apache James server from 3.8 through 3.8.0


### Description

Apache James prior to versions 3.8.1 and 3.7.5 is vulnerable to SMTP smuggling.<br><br>A lenient behaviour in line delimiter handling might create a difference of interpretation between the sender and the receiver which can be exploited by an attacker to forge an SMTP envelop, allowing for instance to bypass SPF checks.<br><br>The patch implies enforcement of CRLF as a line delimiter as part of the DATA transaction.<br><br>We recommend James users to upgrade to non vulnerable versions.<br>
