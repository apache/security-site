## A carefully crafted TNEF file can cause an out of memory exception ## { #CVE-2022-26336 }

### Affected

* poi-scratchpad from unspecified through 5.2.0


### Description

A shortcoming in the HMEF package of poi-scratchpad (Apache POI) allows an attacker to cause an Out of Memory exception. This package is used to read TNEF files (Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server). If an application uses poi-scratchpad to parse TNEF files and the application allows untrusted users to supply them, then a carefully crafted file can cause an Out of Memory exception. This issue affects poi-scratchpad version 5.2.0 and prior versions. Users are recommended to upgrade to poi-scratchpad 5.2.1.

## parsing OOXML based files (xlsx, docx, etc.), poi-ooxml could read unexpected data if underlying zip has duplicate zip entry names ## { #CVE-2025-31672 }

### Affected

* Apache POI before 5.4.0


### Description

Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache POI. The issue affects the parsing of OOXML format files like xlsx, docx and pptx. These file formats are basically zip files and it is possible for malicious users to add zip entries with duplicate names (including the path) in the zip. In this case, products reading the affected file could read different data because 1 of the zip entries with the duplicate name is selected over another but different products may choose a different zip entry.<br>This issue affects Apache POI poi-ooxml before 5.4.0. poi-ooxml 5.4.0 has a check that throws an exception if zip entries with duplicate file names are found in the input file.<br>Users are recommended to upgrade to version poi-ooxml 5.4.0, which fixes the issue. Please read <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://poi.apache.org/security.html">https://poi.apache.org/security.html</a> for recommendations about how to use the POI libraries securely.
