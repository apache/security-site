## Apache Tika Regular Expression Denial of Service in Standards Extractor ## { #CVE-2022-30126 }

CVE-2022-30126 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-30126.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2022-30126.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-05-16T16:58:52.830Z_

### Affected

* Apache Tika from Apache Tika through 1.28.1


### Description

In Apache Tika, a regular expression in our StandardsText class, used by the StandardsExtractingContentHandler could lead to a denial of service caused by backtracking on a specially crafted file. This only affects users who are running the StandardsExtractingContentHandler, which is a non-standard handler.  This is fixed in 1.28.2 and 2.4.0

### Affected

* Apache Tika from Apache Tika through 1.28.2


### Description

We failed to apply the fix for CVE-2022-30126 to the 1.x branch in the 1.28.2 release.  In Apache Tika, a regular expression in the StandardsText class, used by the StandardsExtractingContentHandler could lead to a denial of service caused by backtracking on a specially crafted file. This only affects users who are running the StandardsExtractingContentHandler, which is a non-standard handler.  This is fixed in 1.28.3.

CVE-2022-33879 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-33879.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2022-33879.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-06-27T21:35:12.489Z_

### Affected

* Apache Tika from Apache Tika before 2.4.1


### Description

The initial fixes in CVE-2022-30126 and CVE-2022-30973 for regexes in the StandardsExtractingContentHandler were insufficient, and we found a separate, new regex DoS in a different regex in the StandardsExtractingContentHandler. These are now fixed in 1.28.4 and 2.4.1.
