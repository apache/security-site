## Improper Access Control to Streaming Coordinator & SSRF ## { #CVE-2021-27738 }

CVE-2021-27738 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-27738.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-27738.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-01-06T12:26:35.086Z_

### Affected

* Apache Kylin from Apache Kylin 3 before 3.1.2


### Description

All request mappings in `StreamingCoordinatorController.java` handling `/kylin/api/streaming_coordinator/*` REST API endpoints did not include any security checks, which allowed an unauthenticated user to issue arbitrary requests, such as assigning/unassigning of streaming cubes, creation/modification and deletion of replica sets, to the Kylin Coordinator.

For endpoints accepting node details in HTTP message body, unauthenticated (but limited) server-side request forgery (SSRF) can be achieved.

This issue affects Apache Kylin Apache Kylin 3 versions prior to 3.1.2.

### Affected

* Apache Kylin from Apache Kylin 2 through 2.6.6
* Apache Kylin from Apache Kylin 3 through 3.1.2


### Description

Apache Kylin allows users to read data from other database systems using JDBC. The MySQL JDBC driver supports certain properties, which, if left unmitigated, can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code from a hacker-controlled malicious MySQL server within Kylin server processes. 
This issue affects Apache Kylin 2 version 2.6.6 and prior versions; Apache Kylin 3 version 3.1.2 and prior versions.

CVE-2021-45456 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-45456.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-45456.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-01-06T12:30:40.650Z_

### Affected

* Apache Kylin at Apache Kylin 4 4.0.0


### Description

Apache kylin checks the legitimacy of the project before executing some commands with the project name passed in by the user. There is a mismatch between what is being checked and what is being used as the shell command argument in DiagnosisService. This may cause an illegal project name to pass the check and perform the following steps, resulting in a command injection vulnerability.
This issue affects Apache Kylin 4.0.0.

CVE-2021-45458 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-45458.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-45458.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-01-06T12:33:02.681Z_

### Affected

* Apache Kylin from Apache Kylin 2 through 2.6.6
* Apache Kylin from Apache Kylin 3 through 3.1.2
* Apache Kylin from Apache Kylin 4 through 4.0.0


### Description

Apache Kylin provides encryption classes PasswordPlaceholderConfigurer to help users encrypt their passwords. In the encryption algorithm used by this encryption class, the cipher is initialized with a hardcoded key and IV.  If users use class PasswordPlaceholderConfigurer to encrypt their password and configure it into kylin's configuration file, there is a risk that the password may be decrypted.
This issue affects Apache Kylin 2 version 2.6.6 and prior versions; Apache Kylin 3 version 3.1.2 and prior versions; Apache Kylin 4 version 4.0.0 and prior versions.

## Apache Kylin prior to 4.0.2 allows command injection when the configuration overwrites function overwrites system parameters ## { #CVE-2022-24697 }

CVE-2022-24697 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-24697.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2022-24697.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-10-13T13:05:28.696Z_

### Affected

* Apache Kylin from Apache Kylin 2 before 2.6.6
* Apache Kylin from Apache Kylin 3 through 3.1.2
* Apache Kylin from Apache Kylin 4 through 4.0.1


### Description

Kylin's cube designer function has a command injection vulnerability when overwriting system parameters in the configuration overwrites menu. RCE can be implemented by closing the single quotation marks around the parameter value of “-- conf=” to inject any operating system command into the command line parameters. This vulnerability affects Kylin 2 version 2.6.5 and earlier, Kylin 3 version 3.1.2 and earlier, and Kylin 4 version 4.0.1 and earlier.

### Affected

* Apache Kylin from 2.0.0 through 4.0.3


### Description

<div>In Apache Kylin version 2.0.0 to 4.0.3, there is a Server Config web interface that displays the content of file 'kylin.properties', that may contain serverside credentials. When the kylin service runs over HTTP (or other plain text protocol), it is possible for network sniffers to hijack the HTTP payload and get access to the content of kylin.properties and potentially the containing credentials.<br></div><div><br></div><div>To avoid this threat, users are recommended to&nbsp;</div><div><ol><li>Always turn on HTTPS so that network payload is encrypted.<br></li><li>Avoid putting credentials in kylin.properties, or at least not in plain text.</li><li>Use network firewalls to protect the serverside such that it is not accessible to external attackers.<br></li><li>Upgrade to version Apache Kylin 4.0.4, which filters out the sensitive content that goes to the Server Config web interface.</li></ol><br></div>
