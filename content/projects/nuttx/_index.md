### Affected

* Apache NuttX (incubating) at 10.0.0
* Apache NuttX (incubating) from unspecified through 9.1.0


### Description

Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in TCP Stack of Apache NuttX (incubating) versions up to and including 9.1.0 and 10.0.0 allows attacker to corrupt memory by supplying and invalid fragmentation offset value specified in the IP header.  This is only impacts builds with both CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL  and CONFIG_NET_TCP_REASSEMBLY build flags enabled.

### Affected

* Apache NuttX (incubating) at 10.0.0
* Apache NuttX (incubating) from unspecified before 9.1.1


### Description

Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in TCP stack of Apache NuttX (incubating) versions up to and including 9.1.0 and 10.0.0 allows attacker to corrupt memory by supplying arbitrary urgent data pointer offsets within TCP packets including beyond the length of the packet.

## malloc, realloc and memalign implementations are vulnerable to integer wrap-arounds ## { #CVE-2021-26461 }

CVE-2021-26461 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-26461.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-26461.osv.json)

### Affected

* Apache NuttX from Apache NuttX before 10.1.0


### Description

Apache Nuttx Versions prior to 10.1.0 are vulnerable to integer wrap-around in functions malloc, realloc and memalign. This improper memory assignment can lead to arbitrary memory allocation, resulting in unexpected behavior such as a crash or a remote code injection/execution.

### Affected

* Apache NuttX RTOS: tools/bdf-converter. from 6.9 before 12.9.0


### Description

<p>Out-of-bounds Write resulting in possible Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability was discovered in tools/bdf-converter font conversion utility that is part of Apache NuttX RTOS repository. This standalone program is optional and neither part of NuttX RTOS nor Applications runtime, but active bdf-converter users may be affected when this tool is exposed to external provided user data data (i.e. publicly available automation).</p><p>This issue affects Apache NuttX: from 6.9 before 12.9.0.</p><p>Users are recommended to upgrade to version 12.9.0, which fixes the issue.</p>

### Affected

* Apache NuttX RTOS from 6.22 before 12.9.0


### Description

<p>Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability was discovered in Apache NuttX RTOS apps/exapmles/xmlrpc application. In this example application device stats structure that stored remotely provided parameters had hardcoded buffer size which could lead to buffer overflow. Structure members buffers were updated to valid size of CONFIG_XMLRPC_STRINGSIZE+1.</p><p>This issue affects Apache NuttX RTOS users that may have used or base their code on example application as presented in releases from 6.22 before 12.9.0.</p><p>Users of XMLRPC in Apache NuttX RTOS are advised to review their code 
for this pattern and update buffer sizes as presented in the version of 
the example in release 12.9.0.<br></p>
