# Reporting

Do you want disclose a potential security issue for Apache HTTP Server? You can read more about the projects' security policy on their [security page](https://httpd.apache.org/security_report.html), and email your report to the [Apache HTTP Server Security Team](mailto:security@httpd.apache.org).

# Advisories

This section is experimental: it provides advisories since 2023 and may lag behind the official CVE publications. It may also lack details found on the [project security page](https://httpd.apache.org/security_report.html). If you have any feedback on how you would like this data to be provided, you are welcome to reach out on our public [mailinglist](/mailinglist) or privately on [security@apache.org](mailto:security@apache.org)

## mod_proxy_http NULL pointer dereference ## { #CVE-2020-13950 }

CVE-2020-13950 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2020-13950.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2020-13950.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2021-06-10T07:00:03.831Z_

### Affected

* Apache HTTP Server at 2.4.46
* Apache HTTP Server at 2.4.43
* Apache HTTP Server at 2.4.41


### Description

Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.41 to 2.4.46 mod_proxy_http can be made to crash (NULL pointer dereference) with specially crafted requests using both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers, leading to a Denial of Service

### Description

Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted Digest nonce can cause a stack overflow in mod_auth_digest. There is no report of this overflow being exploitable, nor the Apache HTTP Server team could create one, though some particular compiler and/or compilation option might make it possible, with limited consequences anyway due to the size (a single byte) and the value (zero byte) of the overflow

_Last updated: 2021-06-15T08:48:10.111Z_

### Affected

* Apache HTTP Server at 2.4.47


### Description

Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected.

This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.

This issue affected  mod_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.

### Affected

* Apache HTTP Server from Apache HTTP Server 2.4 through 2.4.48


### Description

A crafted method sent through HTTP/2 will bypass validation and be forwarded by mod_proxy, which can lead to request splitting or cache poisoning.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 to 2.4.48.

## Path traversal and file disclosure vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 ## { #CVE-2021-41773 }

CVE-2021-41773 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-41773.cve.json)

_Last updated: 2021-10-11T14:15:40.313Z_

### Affected

* Apache HTTP Server at Apache HTTP Server 2.4 2.4.49


### Description

A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

This issue is known to be exploited in the wild.

This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions.

### Description

It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient.  An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.  

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

## core: Possible buffer overflow with very large or unlimited LimitXMLRequestBody ## { #CVE-2022-22721 }

CVE-2022-22721 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-22721.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2022-22721.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-03-14T10:08:56.550Z_

### Affected

* Apache HTTP Server from Apache HTTP Server 2.4 through 2.4.52


### Description

If LimitXMLRequestBody is set to allow request bodies larger than 350MB (defaults to 1M) on 32 bit systems an integer overflow happens which later causes out of bounds writes.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.52 and earlier.

_Last updated: 2022-06-10T17:43:34.235Z_

### Affected

* Apache HTTP Server from unspecified through 2.4.53


### Description

The ap_rwrite() function in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may read unintended memory if an attacker can cause the server to reflect very large input using ap_rwrite() or ap_rputs(), such as with mod_luas r:puts() function.

Modules compiled and distributed separately from Apache HTTP Server that use the "ap_rputs" function and may pass it a very large (INT_MAX or larger) string must be compiled against current headers to resolve the issue.

### Affected

* Apache HTTP Server from 2.4.17 through 2.4.57


### Description

When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.<br><br>This was found by the reporter during testing of&nbsp;CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.<br><br>Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.<br>

### Description

A regression in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.60 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers.&nbsp; &nbsp;"AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.<br><br>Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.61, which fixes this issue.

### Affected

* Apache HTTP Server from 2.4 through 2.4.63


### Description

Insufficient escaping of user-supplied data in mod_ssl in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.63 and earlier allows an untrusted SSL/TLS client to insert escape characters into log files in some configurations.<br><br>In a logging configuration where CustomLog is used with "%{varname}x" or "%{varname}c" to log variables provided by mod_ssl such as SSL_TLS_SNI, no escaping is performed by either mod_log_config or mod_ssl and unsanitized data provided by the client may appear in log files.<br><br>

### Affected

* Apache HTTP Server from 2.4.35 through 2.4.63


### Description

In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server 2.4.35 through to 2.4.63, an access control bypass by trusted clients is possible using TLS 1.3 session resumption.<br><br>Configurations are affected when mod_ssl is configured for multiple virtual hosts, with each restricted to a different set of trusted client certificates (for example with a different SSLCACertificateFile/Path setting). In such a case, a client trusted to access one virtual host may be able to access another virtual host, if SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck is not enabled in either virtual host.<br><br>

### Affected

* Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.63


### Description

In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions through to 2.4.63, an HTTP desynchronisation attack allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to hijack an HTTP session via a TLS upgrade.<br><br>Only configurations using "SSLEngine optional" to enable TLS upgrades are affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64, which removes support for TLS upgrade.
