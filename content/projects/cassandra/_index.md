## Remote code execution for scripted UDFs ## { #CVE-2021-44521 }

CVE-2021-44521 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-44521.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-44521.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-02-11T12:02:55.157Z_

### Affected

* Apache Cassandra from 3.0.0 before *


### Description

When running Apache Cassandra with the following configuration:

enable_user_defined_functions: true
enable_scripted_user_defined_functions: true
enable_user_defined_functions_threads: false 

it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host. The attacker would need to have enough permissions to create user defined functions in the cluster to be able to exploit this. Note that this configuration is documented as unsafe, and will continue to be considered unsafe after this CVE.

CVE-2024-27137 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2024-27137.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2024-27137.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2025-02-04T10:19:42.511Z_

### Affected

* Apache Cassandra from 4.0.2 before 4.0.15
* Apache Cassandra from 4.1.0 before 4.1.8
* Apache Cassandra from 5.0-beta1 before 5.0.3


### Description

<p>In Apache Cassandra it is possible for a local attacker without access
 to the Apache Cassandra process or configuration files to manipulate 
the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and capture user 
names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The attacker can 
then use these credentials to access the JMX interface and perform 
unauthorized operations.<br></p><p>This is same vulnerability that CVE-2020-13946 was issued for, but the Java option was changed in JDK10.<br></p><p>This issue affects Apache Cassandra from 4.0.2 through 5.0.2 running Java 11.<br></p><p>Operators are recommended to upgrade to a release equal to or later than 4.0.15, 4.1.8, or 5.0.3 which fixes the issue.<br></p>
