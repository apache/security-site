## Apache Log4j2 JNDI features do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints ## { #CVE-2021-44228 }

CVE-2021-44228 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-44228.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-44228.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2021-12-23T21:53:38.756Z_

### Affected

* Apache Log4j2 from 2.0-beta9 before log4j-core*


### Description

Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed.

Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.

## Apache Log4j2 vulnerable to RCE via JDBC Appender when attacker controls configuration server ## { #CVE-2021-44832 }

CVE-2021-44832 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-44832.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-44832.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2021-12-30T08:25:52.491Z_

### Affected

* Apache Log4j2 from log4j-core before 2.17.1


### Description

Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack when a configuration uses a JDBC Appender with a JNDI LDAP data source URI when an attacker has control of the target LDAP server. This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.

## Deserialization of untrusted data in JMSAppender in Apache Log4j 1.2 ## { #CVE-2021-4104 }

CVE-2021-4104 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-4104.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-4104.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-02-04T08:45:46.335Z_

### Affected

* Apache Log4j 1.x at Apache Log4j 1.2 1.2.x


### Description

JMSAppender in Log4j 1.2 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration. The attacker can provide TopicBindingName and TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configurations causing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228.  

Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.2 when specifically configured to use JMSAppender, which is not the default.

Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.

## Apache Log4j2 Thread Context Lookup Pattern vulnerable to remote code execution in certain non-default configurations ## { #CVE-2021-45046 }

CVE-2021-45046 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-45046.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-45046.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-02-04T08:46:08.709Z_

### Affected

* Apache Log4j2 from log4j-core before 2.16.0


### Description

It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. When the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern, resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments; remote code execution has been demonstrated in operating systems using glibc with the libnss_resolve provider, glibc versions before 2.28, musl, and systemd-resolvd.

Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8), 2.12.2 (Java 7), and 2.3.1 (Java 6) fix this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.

### Affected

* Apache Log4j2 from log4j-core before 2.17.0


### Description

Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 (excluding 2.12.3 and 2.3.1) did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. This allows an attacker with control over Thread Context Map data to cause a denial of service when a crafted string is interpreted. This issue was fixed in Log4j 2.17.0, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1.

## Deserialization of untrusted data in JMSSink in Apache Log4j 1.x ## { #CVE-2022-23302 }

CVE-2022-23302 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-23302.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2022-23302.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-01-18T16:52:09.053Z_

### Affected

* Apache Log4j 1.x from 1.0.1 before *


### Description

JMSSink in all versions of Log4j 1.x is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration or if the configuration references an LDAP service the attacker has access to. The attacker can provide a TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configuration causing JMSSink to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-4104.  

Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use JMSSink, which is not the default.

Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.

## SQL injection in JDBC Appender in Apache Log4j V1 ## { #CVE-2022-23305 }

CVE-2022-23305 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-23305.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2022-23305.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-01-18T15:19:05.615Z_

### Affected

* Apache Log4j 1.x  from 1.2.1 before *


### Description

By design, the JDBCAppender in Log4j 1.2.x accepts an SQL statement as a configuration parameter where the values to be inserted are converters from PatternLayout. The message converter, %m, is likely to always be included. This allows attackers to manipulate the SQL by entering crafted strings into input fields or headers of an application that are logged allowing unintended SQL queries to be executed.

Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use the JDBCAppender, which is not the default. Beginning in version 2.0-beta8, the JDBCAppender was re-introduced with proper support for parameterized SQL queries and further customization over the columns written to in logs.

Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.

## Improper HTML escaping in HTMLLayout ## { #CVE-2025-54812 }

CVE-2025-54812 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2025-54812.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2025-54812.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2025-08-22T18:46:44.374Z_

### Affected

* Apache Log4cxx before 1.5.0


### Description

<p>Improper Output Neutralization for Logs vulnerability in Apache Log4cxx.</p>
<p>When using <code>HTMLLayout</code>, logger names are not properly escaped when writing out to the HTML file.
If untrusted data is used to retrieve the name of a logger, an attacker could theoretically inject HTML or Javascript in order to hide information from logs or steal data from the user.
In order to activate this, the following sequence must occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log4cxx is configured to use <code>HTMLLayout</code>.</li>
<li>Logger name comes from an untrusted string</li>
<li>Logger with compromised name logs a message</li>
<li>User opens the generated HTML log file in their browser, leading to potential XSS</li>
</ol>
<p>Because logger names are generally constant strings, we assess the impact to users as LOW</p>
<p>This issue affects Apache Log4cxx: before <code>1.5.0</code>.</p>
<p>Users are recommended to upgrade to version <code>1.5.0</code>, which fixes the issue.</p>

### Description

<p>Improper Output Neutralization for Logs vulnerability in Apache Log4cxx.</p><p>When using <code>JSONLayout</code>, not all payload bytes are properly escaped. If an attacker-supplied message contains certain non-printable characters, these will be passed along in the message and written out as part of the JSON message. This may prevent applications that consume these logs from correctly interpreting the information within them.</p><p>This issue affects Apache Log4cxx: before <code>1.5.0</code>.</p><p>Users are recommended to upgrade to version <code>1.5.0</code>, which fixes the issue.</p>
