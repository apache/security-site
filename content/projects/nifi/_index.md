## MiNiFi CPP arbitrary script execution is possible on the agent's host machine through the c2 protocol ## { #CVE-2021-33191 }

CVE-2021-33191 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-33191.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-33191.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2021-08-24T11:14:05.278Z_

### Affected

* Apache NiFi - MiNiFi C++ from 0.5.0 before Apache NiFi - MiNiFi C++*


### Description

From Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++ version 0.5.0 the c2 protocol implements an "agent-update" command which was designed to patch the application binary. 
This "patching" command defaults to calling a trusted binary, but might be modified to an arbitrary value through a "c2-update"
command. Said command is then executed using the same privileges as the application binary.  This was addressed in version 0.10.0

## Insufficiently protected credentials ## { #CVE-2022-26850 }

CVE-2022-26850 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-26850.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2022-26850.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-04-06T20:48:13.265Z_

### Affected

* Apache NiFi at NiFi 1.14.0 to 1.15.3


### Description

When creating or updating credentials for single-user access, Apache NiFi wrote a copy of the Login Identity Providers configuration to the operating system temporary directory. On most platforms, the operating system temporary directory has global read permissions. NiFi immediately moved the temporary file to the final configuration directory, which significantly limited the window of opportunity for access.

NiFi 1.16.0 includes updates to replace the Login Identity Providers configuration without writing a file to the operating system temporary directory.

## Improper Restriction of XML External Entity References in Multiple Components ## { #CVE-2022-29265 }

CVE-2022-29265 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-29265.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2022-29265.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-04-30T08:01:30.969Z_

### Affected

* Apache NiFi from 0.0.1 to 1.16.0 through 0.0.1 to 1.16.0


### Description

Multiple components in Apache NiFi 0.0.1 to 1.16.0 do not restrict XML External Entity references in the default configuration.

The Standard Content Viewer service attempts to resolve XML External Entity references when viewing formatted XML files.

The following Processors attempt to resolve XML External Entity references when configured with default property values:

- EvaluateXPath
- EvaluateXQuery
- ValidateXml

Apache NiFi flow configurations that include these Processors are vulnerable to malicious XML documents that contain Document Type Declarations with XML External Entity references.

The resolution disables Document Type Declarations in the default configuration for these Processors, and disallows XML External Entity resolution in standard services.

## Improper Neutralization of Command Elements in Shell User Group Provider ## { #CVE-2022-33140 }

CVE-2022-33140 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-33140.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2022-33140.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-06-15T14:21:09.085Z_

### Affected

* Apache NiFi from up to 1.16.2 through 1.16.2
* Apache NiFi from 1.10.0 before 1.10.0*
* Apache NiFi Registry from up to 1.16.2 through 1.16.2
* Apache NiFi Registry from 0.6.0 before 0.6.0*


### Description

The optional ShellUserGroupProvider in Apache NiFi 1.10.0 to 1.16.2 and Apache NiFi Registry 0.6.0 to 1.16.2 does not neutralize arguments for group resolution commands, allowing injection of operating system commands on Linux and macOS platforms.

The ShellUserGroupProvider is not included in the default configuration. Command injection requires ShellUserGroupProvider to be one of the enabled User Group Providers in the Authorizers configuration. Command injection also requires an authenticated user with elevated privileges.  Apache NiFi requires an authenticated user with authorization to modify access policies in order to execute the command. Apache NiFi Registry requires an authenticated user with authorization to read user groups in order to execute the command.

The resolution removes command formatting based on user-provided arguments.

_Last updated: 2023-07-29T07:12:37.941Z_

### Affected

* Apache NiFi from 0.0.2 through 1.22.0


### Description

Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.22.0 include Processors and Controller Services that support HTTP URL references for retrieving drivers, which allows an authenticated and authorized user to configure a location that enables custom code execution. The resolution introduces a new Required Permission for referencing remote resources, restricting configuration of these components to privileged users. The permission prevents unprivileged users from configuring Processors and Controller Services annotated with the new Reference Remote Resources restriction. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.23.0 is the recommended mitigation.<br>

## Potential Insertion of Sensitive Parameter Values in Debug Log ## { #CVE-2024-52067 }

CVE-2024-52067 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2024-52067.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2024-52067.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2024-11-21T09:28:41.996Z_

### Affected

* Apache NiFi from 1.16.0 through 1.28.0
* Apache NiFi from 2.0.0-M1 through 2.0.0-M4


### Description

Apache NiFi 1.16.0 through 1.28.0 and 2.0.0-M1 through 2.0.0-M4 include optional debug logging of Parameter Context values during the flow synchronization process. An authorized administrator with access to change logging levels could enable debug logging for framework flow synchronization, causing the application to write Parameter names and values to the application log. Parameter Context values may contain sensitive information depending on application flow configuration. Deployments of Apache NiFi with the default Logback configuration do not log Parameter Context values. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.0.0 or 1.28.1 is the recommendation mitigation, eliminating Parameter value logging from the flow synchronization process regardless of the Logback configuration.<br>

_Last updated: 2024-12-29T11:14:49.689Z_

### Affected

* Apache NiFi from 1.10.0 through 2.0.0


### Description

Apache NiFi 1.10.0 through 2.0.0 are missing fine-grained authorization checking for Parameter Contexts, referenced Controller Services, and referenced Parameter Providers, when creating new Process Groups.<br><br>Creating a new Process Group can include binding to a Parameter Context, but in cases where the Process Group did not reference any Parameter values, the framework did not check user authorization for the bound Parameter Context. Missing authorization for a bound Parameter Context enabled clients to download non-sensitive Parameter values after creating the Process Group.<br><br>Creating a new Process Group can also include referencing existing Controller Services or Parameter Providers. The framework did not check user authorization for referenced Controller Services or Parameter Providers, enabling clients to create Process Groups and use these components that were otherwise unauthorized.<br><br>This vulnerability is limited in scope to authenticated users authorized to create Process Groups. The scope is further limited to deployments with component-based authorization policies. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.1.0 is the recommended mitigation, which includes authorization checking for Parameter and Controller Service references on Process Group creation.<br>
