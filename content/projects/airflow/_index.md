### Affected

* Apache Airflow from Apache Airflow before 1.10.13


### Description

The "origin" parameter passed to some of the endpoints like '/trigger' was vulnerable to XSS exploit. This issue affects Apache Airflow versions prior to 1.10.13.

This is same as CVE-2020-13944 but the implemented fix in Airflow 1.10.13 did not fix the issue completely.

### Affected

* Apache Airflow from Apache Airflow before 1.10.14


### Description

Incorrect Session Validation in Apache Airflow Webserver versions prior to 1.10.14 with default config allows a malicious airflow user on site A where they log in normally, to access unauthorized Airflow Webserver on Site B through the session from Site A.  This does not affect users who have changed the default value for `[webserver] secret_key` config.

## CWE-284 Improper Access Control on Configurations Endpoint for the Stable API ## { #CVE-2021-26559 }

CVE-2021-26559 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-26559.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-26559.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2021-02-17T13:18:02.283Z_

### Affected

* Apache Airflow at 2.0.0


### Description

Improper Access Control on Configurations Endpoint for the Stable API of Apache Airflow allows users with Viewer or User role to get Airflow Configurations including sensitive information even when `[webserver] expose_config` is set to `False` in `airflow.cfg`. 

This allowed a privilege escalation attack.

This issue affects Apache Airflow 2.0.0.

## Apache Airflow: Lineage API endpoint for Experimental API missed authentication check ## { #CVE-2021-26697 }

CVE-2021-26697 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-26697.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-26697.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2021-02-17T14:10:43.736Z_

### Affected

* Apache Airflow at 2.0.0


### Description

The lineage endpoint of the deprecated Experimental API was not protected by authentication in Airflow 2.0.0. This allowed unauthenticated users to hit that endpoint.

This is low-severity issue as the attacker needs to be aware of certain parameters to pass to that endpoint and even after can just get some metadata about a DAG and a Task.

This issue affects Apache Airflow 2.0.0.

### Description

Prior to version 4.1.3, this was not called out in the documentation explicitly, so it is possible that administrators provided authorizations to configure Spark hooks without taking this into account. We recommend administrators to review their configurations to make sure the authorization to configure Spark hooks is only provided to fully trusted users.<br><br>To view the warning in the docs please visit&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-apache-spark/4.1.3/connections/spark.html">https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-apache-spark/4.1.3/connections/spark.html</a><br><br><br></span>

## Session fixation in Apache Airflow web interface ## { #CVE-2023-40273 }

CVE-2023-40273 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2023-40273.cve.json)

_Last updated: 2023-09-12T06:41:25.454Z_

### Affected

* Apache Airflow before 2.7.0


### Description

<p>The session fixation vulnerability allowed the authenticated user to continue accessing Airflow webserver even after the password of the user has been reset by the admin - up until the expiry of the session of the user. Other than manually cleaning the session database (for <code>database</code>&nbsp;session backend), or changing the secure_key and restarting the webserver, there were no mechanisms to force-logout the user (and all other users with that).</p><p>With this fix implemented, when using the&nbsp;<code>database</code>&nbsp;session backend, the existing sessions of the user are invalidated when the password of the user is reset. When using the <code>securecookie</code>&nbsp;session backend, the sessions are NOT invalidated and still require changing the secure key and restarting the webserver (and logging out all other users), but the user resetting the password is informed about it with a flash message warning displayed in the UI. Documentation is also updated explaining this behaviour.</p>Users of Apache Airflow are advised to upgrade to version 2.7.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability.<br>

### Affected

* Apache Airflow from 2.6.0 before 2.8.0


### Description

Apache Airflow, versions 2.6.0 through 2.7.3 has a stored XSS vulnerability that allows a DAG author to add an unbounded and not-sanitized javascript in the parameter description field of the DAG.&nbsp;This Javascript can be executed on the client side of any of the user who looks at the tasks in the browser sandbox. While this issue does not allow to exit the browser sandbox or manipulation of the server-side data - more than the DAG author already has, it allows to modify what the user looking at the DAG details sees in the browser - which opens up all kinds of possibilities of misleading other users.<br><br>Users of Apache Airflow are recommended to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability<br>

### Affected

* Apache Airflow before 2.8.0


### Description

Apache Airflow, in versions prior to 2.8.0, contains a security vulnerability that allows an authenticated user with limited access to some DAGs, to craft a request that could give the user write access to various DAG resources for DAGs that the user had no access to, thus, enabling the user to clear DAGs they shouldn't.<br><br>This is a missing fix for CVE-2023-42792 in Apache Airflow 2.7.2&nbsp;<br><br>Users of Apache Airflow are strongly advised to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability.

### Affected

* Apache Airflow CNCF Kubernetes provider from 5.2.0 before 7.0.0
* Apache Airflow from 2.3.0 before 2.6.1


### Description

Since version 5.2.0, when using deferrable mode with the path of a Kubernetes configuration file for authentication, the Airflow worker serializes this configuration file as a dictionary and sends it to the triggerer by storing it in metadata without any encryption. Additionally, if used with an Airflow version between 2.3.0 and 2.6.0, the configuration dictionary will be logged as plain text in the triggerer service without masking. This allows anyone with access to the metadata or triggerer log to obtain the configuration file and use it to access the Kubernetes cluster.<br><br>This behavior was changed in version 7.0.0, which stopped serializing the file contents and started providing the file path instead to read the contents into the trigger. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 7.0.0, which fixes this issue.

### Affected

* Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3


### Description

Improper Preservation of Permissions vulnerability in Apache Airflow.<p>This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3.</p><p></p><p>Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix <code>group</code>&nbsp;of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.</p><p>If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.</p><p>This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/">https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/</a>) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.</p><p>You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.</p><p>Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.</p><p>Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:</p><ul><li>if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root</li><li>upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above</li><li>If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions">https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions</a>&nbsp;to 0o755 (original value 0o775).</li><li>if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of <code>AIRFLOW_HOME/logs</code>&nbsp;in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories</li></ul><br><p></p>

### Affected

* Apache Airflow before 2.10.1


### Description

Apache Airflow versions before 2.10.1 have a vulnerability that allows&nbsp;DAG authors to add local settings to the DAG folder and get it executed by the scheduler, where the scheduler is not supposed to execute code submitted by the DAG author. <br>Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.10.1 or later, which has fixed the vulnerability.

### Affected

* Apache Airflow at 2.10.0


### Description

Example DAG: example_inlet_event_extra.py shipped with Apache Airflow version 2.10.0 has a vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker with only DAG trigger permission to execute arbitrary commands. If you used that example as the base of your DAGs - please review if you have not copied the dangerous example; see <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41873">https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41873</a>&nbsp;for more information. We recommend against exposing the example DAGs in your deployment. If you must expose the example DAGs, upgrade Airflow to version 2.10.1 or later.<br>

### Affected

* Apache Airflow before 2.10.3


### Description

Apache Airflow versions before 2.10.3 contain a vulnerability that could expose sensitive configuration variables in task logs. This vulnerability allows DAG authors to unintentionally or intentionally log sensitive configuration variables. Unauthorized users could access these logs, potentially exposing critical data that could be exploited to compromise the security of the Airflow deployment. In version 2.10.3, secrets are now masked in task logs to prevent sensitive configuration variables from being exposed in the logging output. Users should upgrade to Airflow 2.10.3 or the latest version to eliminate this vulnerability.&nbsp;If you suspect that DAG authors could have logged the secret values to the logs and that your logs are not additionally protected, it is also recommended that you update those secrets.

### Affected

* Apache Airflow before 2.10.3


### Description

Airflow versions before 2.10.3 have a vulnerability that allows authenticated users with audit log access to see sensitive values in audit logs which they should not see.&nbsp;When sensitive variables were set via airflow CLI, values of those variables appeared in the audit log and were stored unencrypted in the Airflow database. While this risk is limited to users with audit log access, it is recommended to upgrade to Airflow 2.10.3 or a later version, which addresses this issue. Users who previously used the CLI to set secret variables should manually delete entries with those variables from the log table.
