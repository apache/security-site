## ActiveMQ: LDAP-Authentication does not verify passwords on servers with anonymous bind ## { #CVE-2021-26117 }

CVE-2021-26117 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-26117.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-26117.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2021-01-27T18:47:20.605Z_

### Affected

* Apache ActiveMQ from Apache ActiveMQ Artemis before 2.16.0
* Apache ActiveMQ from Apache ActiveMQ before 5.16.1


### Description

The optional ActiveMQ LDAP login module can be configured to use anonymous access to the LDAP server. In this case, for Apache ActiveMQ Artemis prior to version 2.16.0 and Apache ActiveMQ prior to versions 5.16.1 and 5.15.14, the anonymous context is used to verify a valid users password in error, resulting in no check on the password.

### Affected

* Apache ActiveMQ Artemis from unspecified before 2.16.0


### Description

While investigating ARTEMIS-2964 it was found that the creation of advisory messages in the OpenWire protocol head of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis 2.15.0 bypassed policy based access control for the entire session. Production of advisory messages was not subject to access control in error.

## Insufficient API restrictions on Jolokia allow authenticated users to perform RCE ## { #CVE-2022-41678 }

CVE-2022-41678 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-41678.cve.json)

_Last updated: 2024-05-31T08:42:39.786Z_

### Affected

* Apache ActiveMQ before 5.16.6
* Apache ActiveMQ from 5.17.0 before 5.17.4
* Apache ActiveMQ at 5.18.0
* Apache ActiveMQ at 6.0.0


### Description

<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Once an user is authenticated on Jolokia, he can potentially trigger arbitrary code execution.&nbsp;<br><br>In details, in ActiveMQ configurations, jetty allows
org.jolokia.http.AgentServlet to handler request to /api/jolokia<br><br>org.jolokia.http.HttpRequestHandler#handlePostRequest is able to
create JmxRequest through JSONObject. And calls to
org.jolokia.http.HttpRequestHandler#executeRequest.<br><br>Into deeper calling stacks,
org.jolokia.handler.ExecHandler#doHandleRequest is able to invoke
through refection.

And then, RCE is able to be achieved via
jdk.management.jfr.FlightRecorderMXBeanImpl which exists on Java version above 11.

1 Call newRecording.
<br>
2 Call setConfiguration. And a webshell data hides in it.
<br>
3 Call startRecording.
<br>
4 Call copyTo method. The webshell will be written to a .jsp file.<br><br></span>The mitigation is to restrict (by default) the actions authorized on Jolokia, or disable Jolokia.<br>A more restrictive Jolokia configuration has been defined in default ActiveMQ distribution. We encourage users to upgrade to ActiveMQ distributions version including updated Jolokia configuration: 5.16.6, 5.17.4, 5.18.0, 6.0.0.<br>

## Unbounded deserialization causes ActiveMQ to be vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack ## { #CVE-2023-46604 }

CVE-2023-46604 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2023-46604.cve.json)

_Last updated: 2023-11-28T15:02:26.708Z_

### Affected

* Apache ActiveMQ from 5.18.0 before 5.18.3
* Apache ActiveMQ from 5.17.0 before 5.17.6
* Apache ActiveMQ from 5.16.0 before 5.16.7
* Apache ActiveMQ before 5.15.16
* Apache ActiveMQ Legacy OpenWire Module from 5.18.0 before 5.18.3
* Apache ActiveMQ Legacy OpenWire Module from 5.17.0 before 5.17.6
* Apache ActiveMQ Legacy OpenWire Module from 5.16.0 before 5.16.7
* Apache ActiveMQ Legacy OpenWire Module from 5.8.0 before 5.15.16


### Description

<div>The Java OpenWire protocol marshaller is vulnerable to Remote Code 
Execution. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker with network 
access to either a Java-based OpenWire broker or client to run arbitrary
 shell commands by manipulating serialized class types in the OpenWire 
protocol to cause either the client or the broker (respectively) to 
instantiate any class on the classpath.</div><div><br></div><div>Users are recommended to upgrade
 both brokers and clients to version 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, or 5.18.3 
which fixes this issue.</div>

## Authenticated users could perform RCE via Jolokia MBeans ## { #CVE-2023-50780 }

CVE-2023-50780 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2023-50780.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2023-50780.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2024-10-14T16:03:33.323Z_

### Affected

* Apache ActiveMQ Artemis before 2.29.0


### Description

<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis allows access to diagnostic information and controls through MBeans, which are also exposed through the authenticated Jolokia endpoint. Before version 2.29.0, this also included the Log4J2 MBean. This MBean is not meant for exposure to non-administrative users. This could eventually allow an authenticated attacker to write arbitrary files to the filesystem and indirectly achieve RCE.<br></p><p>Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.29.0 or later, which fixes the issue.</p>

## Jolokia and REST API were not secured with default configuration ## { #CVE-2024-32114 }

CVE-2024-32114 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2024-32114.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2024-32114.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2024-05-01T16:07:22.140Z_

### Affected

* Apache ActiveMQ from 6.0.0 through 6.1.1


### Description

In Apache ActiveMQ 6.x, the default configuration doesn't secure the API web context (where the Jolokia JMX REST API and the Message REST API are located).<br>It means that anyone can use these layers without any required authentication. Potentially, anyone can interact with the broker (using Jolokia JMX REST API) and/or produce/consume messages or purge/delete destinations (using the Message REST API).<br><br>To mitigate, users can update the default conf/jetty.xml configuration file to add authentication requirement:<br><blockquote><pre>&lt;bean id="securityConstraintMapping" class="org.eclipse.jetty.security.ConstraintMapping"&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;property name="constraint" ref="securityConstraint" /&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;property name="pathSpec" value="/" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</pre></blockquote>Or we encourage users to upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 6.1.2 where the default configuration has been updated with authentication by default.<br>

## Address routing-type can be updated by user without the createAddress permission ## { #CVE-2025-27427 }

CVE-2025-27427 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2025-27427.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2025-27427.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2025-04-01T07:26:53.803Z_

### Affected

* Apache ActiveMQ Artemis from 2.0.0 through 2.39.0


### Description

<p>A vulnerability exists in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis whereby a user with the createDurableQueue or createNonDurableQueue permission on an address can augment the routing-type supported by that address even if said user doesn't have the createAddress permission for that particular address. When combined with the send permission and automatic queue creation a user could successfully send a message with a routing-type not supported by the address when that message should actually be rejected on the basis that the user doesn't have permission to change the routing-type of the address.</p><p>This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ Artemis from 2.0.0 through 2.39.0.</p><p>Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.40.0 which fixes the issue.</p>
