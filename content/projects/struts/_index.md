## Forced OGNL evaluation, when evaluated on raw not validated user input in tag attributes, may lead to RCE. ## { #CVE-2021-31805 }

CVE-2021-31805 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-31805.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-31805.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-04-12T15:23:33.186Z_

### Affected

* Apache Struts at 2.0.0 to 2.5.29


### Description

The fix issued for CVE-2020-17530 was incomplete. So from Apache Struts 2.0.0 to 2.5.29, still some of the tagâ€™s attributes could perform a double evaluation if a developer applied forced OGNL evaluation by using the %{...} syntax. Using forced OGNL evaluation on untrusted user input can lead to a Remote Code Execution and security degradation.

## Improper Output Neutralization for Logs ## { #CVE-2025-54656 }

CVE-2025-54656 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2025-54656.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2025-54656.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2025-07-30T15:58:00.516Z_

### Affected

* Apache Struts Extras before 2


### Description

<p>** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Output Neutralization for Logs vulnerability in Apache Struts.</p><p>This issue affects Apache Struts Extras: before 2.</p><p>When using LookupDispatchAction, in some cases, Struts may print untrusted input to the logs without any filtering. Specially-crafted input may lead to log output where part of the message masquerades as a separate log line, confusing consumers of the logs (either human or automated).&nbsp;</p><p>As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.</p><p>NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.</p>
