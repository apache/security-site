{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2025-68438", "summary": "Secrets in rendered templates could contain parts of sensitive values when truncated", "details": "In Apache Airflow versions before 3.1.6, when rendered template fields in a Dag exceed [core] max_templated_field_length, sensitive values could be exposed in cleartext in the Rendered Templates UI. This occurred because serialization of those fields used a secrets masker instance that did not include user-registered mask_secret() patterns, so secrets were not reliably masked before truncation and display.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to 3.1.6 or later, which fixes this issue", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "3.1.0"}, {"fixed": "3.1.6"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/55n7b4nlsz3vo5n4h5lrj9bfsk8ctyff"}]}
