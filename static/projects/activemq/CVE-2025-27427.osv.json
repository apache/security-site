{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2025-27427", "summary": "Address routing-type can be updated by user without the createAddress permission", "details": "A vulnerability exists in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis whereby a user with the createDurableQueue or createNonDurableQueue permission on an address can augment the routing-type supported by that address even if said user doesn't have the createAddress permission for that particular address. When combined with the send permission and automatic queue creation a user could successfully send a message with a routing-type not supported by the address when that message should actually be rejected on the basis that the user doesn't have permission to change the routing-type of the address.\n\nThis issue affects Apache ActiveMQ Artemis from 2.0.0 through 2.39.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.40.0 which fixes the issue.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.0.0"}, {"last_affected": "2.0.0"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/8dzlm2vkqphyrnkrby8r8kzndsm5o6x8"}]}
