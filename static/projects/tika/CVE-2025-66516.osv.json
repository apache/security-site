However, this CVE expands the scope of affected packages in two ways. \n\nFirst, while the entrypoint for the vulnerability was the tika-parser-pdf-module as reported in CVE-2025-54988, the vulnerability and its fix were in tika-core. Users who upgraded the tika-parser-pdf-module but did not upgrade tika-core to >= 3.2.2 would still be vulnerable. \n\nSecond, the original report failed to mention that in the 1.x Tika releases, the PDFParser was in the \"org.apache.tika:tika-parsers\" module.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "1.13"}, {"last_affected": "1.13"}]}]}, {"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "1.13"}, {"fixed": "2.0.0"}]}]}, {"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.0.0"}, {"last_affected": "2.0.0"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/s5x3k93nhbkqzztp1olxotoyjpdlps9k"}, {"type": "WEB", "url": "https://cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54988"}]}
