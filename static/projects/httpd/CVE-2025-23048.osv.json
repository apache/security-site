{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2025-23048", "summary": "mod_ssl access control bypass with session resumption", "details": "In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server 2.4.35 through to 2.4.63, an access control bypass by trusted clients is possible using TLS 1.3 session resumption.\n\nConfigurations are affected when mod_ssl is configured for multiple virtual hosts, with each restricted to a different set of trusted client certificates (for example with a different SSLCACertificateFile/Path setting). In such a case, a client trusted to access one virtual host may be able to access another virtual host, if SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck is not enabled in either virtual host.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.4.35"}, {"last_affected": "2.4.35"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html"}]}
