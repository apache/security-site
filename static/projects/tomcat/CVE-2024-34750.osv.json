{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2024-34750", "summary": "HTTP/2 excess header handling DoS", "details": "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn led to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which should have been closed.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25 or 9.0.90, which fixes the issue.\n\n", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "11.0.0-M1"}, {"last_affected": "11.0.0-M1"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "10.1.0-M1"}, {"last_affected": "10.1.0-M1"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "9.0.0-M1"}, {"last_affected": "9.0.0-M1"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/4kqf0bc9gxymjc2x7v3p7dvplnl77y8l"}]}
